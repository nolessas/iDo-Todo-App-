# iDo App - Front-End Implementation

iDo App is a simple, yet powerful todo list manager built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project represents the front-end implementation of a todo application, designed to work with a C# backend Swagger API.

## Features

- User authentication (login and registration)
- Create, read, update, and delete todo items
- Mark todos as completed
- Sort todos by date, content, or type
- Filter todos based on user input
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- RESTful API integration

## Backend API

This front-end implementation is designed to work with a C# backend Swagger API. The API provides endpoints for user authentication and todo CRUD operations. For more information about the backend API, please refer to the [ToDo-API-for-FE-CA](https://github.com/Atikas/ToDo-API-for-FE-CA) repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- Access to the C# backend API (ensure it's running)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nolessas/iDo-Todo-App-.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ido-app-frontend
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser or use a local server to run the application.

4. Ensure the backend API is running and accessible at the correct endpoint (default: `https://localhost:7171/api`).

## Usage

1. Register a new account or log in with existing credentials.
2. Add new todos using the form at the top of the todo list.
